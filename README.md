# Task 1. Software configuration

## Subtask1. Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?

Hello, my name is Olha ðŸ‘‹

I'm taking part in this portfolio_challenge because I'm interested in trying new things. In the direction of automatic testing, I looked for a long time, but I thought that it was very difficult. Seeing the opportunity to learn this, I thought "why not?".  At the same time, I was very interested in the possibility of an internship, so I ended up here.

Thank you for this opportunity, I will be glad to spend the next 6 weeks with you and learn new things from you.
